# 📘 Lecture 2: Introduction to E-Commerce Website in HTML

## 💡 Project Name:

**e_commerce_website_html**

## 🔹 Objective:

I have a stock of **laptops and mobiles** and I want to sell them online.  
The solution is to build an **E-Commerce website** so customers can buy products from my website easily.

---

## 🧭 When a User Visits the Website

- When a user types a domain like `Thia.pk`, the **first page** that opens is called the **home page**.
- This home page is usually named **`index.html`** or **`home.html`**.
- In our case, we named it **`index.html`**.

---

## 🧾 Sidebar Menu using HTML

- We're adding a **menu on the side** of the page.
- To build this menu, we're using the **`<ul>` (unordered list)** tag in HTML.
- We'll keep improving this menu structure.

---

## 🔐 Pages to Add

- We added **Register** and **Login** pages to the menu list.

---

✅ **Next Step**: We’ll continue building and enhancing the menu and connect it to all important pages.

# 📘 Lecture 3: Creating Home Page with DIV Tag

In this lecture, we learned how to create the **Home Page** for our E-commerce website.

## 🔹 Key Points:

### ✅ Copy Structure:

We copied the `index.html` file and saved it as `home.html` for the homepage layout.

### ✅ Understanding `<div>` Tag:

The `<div>` tag is used to create sections or blocks on a web page.  
We created **3 boxes**, and each box is made using a `<div>` tag.

### ✅ Navigation Setup:

We linked the **Home** button to `home.html` so that clicking on it opens the Home page.

### ✅ Next Step:

You will create all other pages similarly and use `<div>` tags to organize content on each page.

---

✅ **That’s it — you now know how to build a structured homepage using HTML and the `<div>` tag!**

# Lecture 4: Creating and Linking New Pages

In this lecture, we will create new pages for our website and link them properly to ensure smooth navigation.

---

## ✅ Step 1: Create the **Products Page**

1. Copy the code from the existing `home.html` file.
2. Create a new file named `products.html`.
3. Paste the copied code into `products.html`.
4. Modify the content in `products.html` as needed to reflect product-related information.
5. Ensure the **Products** page is properly linked in the navigation menu so users can access it.

---

## ✅ Step 2: Create the **About Page**

1. Repeat the process used for the Products page:
   - Copy the existing structure from `home.html`.
   - Create a new file named `about.html`.
   - Paste the code and update the content for the About section.
2. Add a navigation link to the **About** page just like we did for the **Products** page.

---

## 📌 Summary

- ✔️ We created `products.html` and linked it.
- ✔️ We created `about.html` and linked it.
- ✅ Navigation between all pages is now functional.

> This marks the completion of **Lecture 4**.

# 📚 Lecture 5: Creating and Linking Pages in an E-Commerce HTML Website

**Date:** _19_April_2025_  
**Topic:** Connecting Pages and Creating the Contact Page

---

## 👋 Introduction

**Assalamu Alaikum!**  
I hope you all are doing well.

In today’s lecture, we will focus on completing the internal linking of our e-commerce website and creating any missing pages.

---

## ✅ Objectives of the Lecture

- Complete internal page links

We began by ensuring all navigation links (e.g., Home, Products, About, Cart, etc.) are correctly connected to their respective HTML files. This step is essential to maintain a seamless user experience throughout the website.

---

## ❌ Contact Page Issue

While testing the navigation, we noticed that the **Contact** page link was not working.

**Problem Identified:**

> The `contact.html` file does not exist yet — that’s why the page is not opening.

---

## 🛠️ Solution: Create the Contact Page

To fix this issue, we created a new file:

```plaintext
contact.html
```

# Lecture 6 - Fixing Missing Navigation Links

Today, we resolved an issue where some pages (Home, Products, About) were displaying the navigation menu without functional links.

### Root Cause:

Incomplete `<ul>` menu structure on those pages.

### Fix:

Copied the full navigation menu from `index.html` and replaced the incomplete sections on affected pages.

### Result:

Navigation links are now working correctly on all pages.

# Lecture 7: Add Home Page Content

## 📌 Objective

In this lecture, we will enhance our homepage by adding a banner image and a heading.

---

## ✅ What We Did Previously

We had a simple message displayed on the home page:

```html
<div>Welcome to Home</div>
```

---

## 🚀 Today's Goals

We will now update the home page with proper content:

### 1. Search & Download Banner Image

- Go to Google and search for:  
  **"Home Banner Image for E-Commerce Website"**
- Download a banner image that suits your homepage design.

### 2. Project Setup

- Create an `images` folder inside your project directory (if not already present).
- Place the downloaded banner image inside the `images` folder.

### 3. Update Home Page Code

In your HTML file, add the following code:

```html
<h1>Welcome to Our E-Commerce Store</h1>
<img src="images/banner.jpg" width="900px" alt="E-Commerce Banner" />
```

> Replace `banner.jpg` with your actual image filename.

---

## 🎉 Summary

- Added a heading (`<h1>`) to the homepage.
- Displayed a banner image with a width of 900px.
- Improved the visual presentation of the homepage.
