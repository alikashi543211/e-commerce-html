# 📘 Lecture 2: Introduction to E-Commerce Website in HTML

## 💡 Project Name:
**e_commerce_website_html**

## 🔹 Objective:
I have a stock of **laptops and mobiles** and I want to sell them online.  
The solution is to build an **E-Commerce website** so customers can buy products from my website easily.

---

## 🧭 When a User Visits the Website

- When a user types a domain like `Thia.pk`, the **first page** that opens is called the **home page**.
- This home page is usually named **`index.html`** or **`home.html`**.
- In our case, we named it **`index.html`**.

---

## 🧾 Sidebar Menu using HTML

- We're adding a **menu on the side** of the page.
- To build this menu, we're using the **`<ul>` (unordered list)** tag in HTML.
- We'll keep improving this menu structure.

---

## 🔐 Pages to Add

- We added **Register** and **Login** pages to the menu list.

---

✅ **Next Step**: We’ll continue building and enhancing the menu and connect it to all important pages.


# 📘 Lecture 3: Creating Home Page with DIV Tag

In this lecture, we learned how to create the **Home Page** for our E-commerce website.

## 🔹 Key Points:

### ✅ Copy Structure:
We copied the `index.html` file and saved it as `home.html` for the homepage layout.

### ✅ Understanding `<div>` Tag:
The `<div>` tag is used to create sections or blocks on a web page.  
We created **3 boxes**, and each box is made using a `<div>` tag.

### ✅ Navigation Setup:
We linked the **Home** button to `home.html` so that clicking on it opens the Home page.

### ✅ Next Step:
You will create all other pages similarly and use `<div>` tags to organize content on each page.

---

✅ **That’s it — you now know how to build a structured homepage using HTML and the `<div>` tag!**
# Lecture 4: Creating and Linking New Pages

In this lecture, we will create new pages for our website and link them properly to ensure smooth navigation.

---

## ✅ Step 1: Create the **Products Page**

1. Copy the code from the existing `home.html` file.
2. Create a new file named `products.html`.
3. Paste the copied code into `products.html`.
4. Modify the content in `products.html` as needed to reflect product-related information.
5. Ensure the **Products** page is properly linked in the navigation menu so users can access it.

---

## ✅ Step 2: Create the **About Page**

1. Repeat the process used for the Products page:
   - Copy the existing structure from `home.html`.
   - Create a new file named `about.html`.
   - Paste the code and update the content for the About section.
2. Add a navigation link to the **About** page just like we did for the **Products** page.

---

## 📌 Summary

- ✔️ We created `products.html` and linked it.
- ✔️ We created `about.html` and linked it.
- ✅ Navigation between all pages is now functional.

> This marks the completion of **Lecture 4**.
