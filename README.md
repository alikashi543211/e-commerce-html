# ðŸ“˜ Lecture 3: Creating Home Page with DIV Tag

In this lecture, we learned how to create the **Home Page** for our E-commerce website.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Points:

### âœ… Copy Structure:
We copied the `index.html` file and saved it as `home.html` for the homepage layout.

### âœ… Understanding `<div>` Tag:
The `<div>` tag is used to create sections or blocks on a web page.  
We created **3 boxes**, and each box is made using a `<div>` tag.

### âœ… Navigation Setup:
We linked the **Home** button to `home.html` so that clicking on it opens the Home page.

### âœ… Next Step:
You will create all other pages similarly and use `<div>` tags to organize content on each page.
